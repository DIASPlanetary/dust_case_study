This repository contains the code used for the study of the role of dust in the Jovian moon environment, studying the likelyhood of their interaction in energetic ion depletion and with the magnetic field, in order to account for possible future scenarios in modelling for Europa Clipper (NASA) and JUICE (ESA) data, after their arrival around 2030.
